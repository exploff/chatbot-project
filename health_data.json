        "answer": "You just put the mop in the wringer section and twist it. It works great. I was sceptical at first but it really works and without great effort. You do have to use a small to medium size mop. This is not made for industrial use."

        "question": "alcohol, perfume, limonen, citral: What justifies the cost for these inexpensive ingredients?",
        "answer": "I've had this shaver almost a year now and I refill my cartridges myself. One purchase of these items will last you at least a year. Here's how: Purchase the following items: a) S-L-X Denatured Alcohol (can be found at local Home Depot) b) Machine Oil (can also be called Sewing machine oil or Shredder oil/lubricant) (can be found at local OfficeMax/Office Depot/Staples) c) Pure Lemon Extract (can be found at local grocery store) 1) Take the used cartridge out and wash it out thoroughly with water. 2) Let it dry upside down in the sink overnight. 3) Add 1/2 tsp of machine oil, 1/2 tsp lemon extract, and fill the rest with the denatured alcohol. It might be easier to pour the alcohol into the cartridge using a small funnel. Also it is important that you use lemon extract and NOT lemon juice. Those are not the same thing. That's it."

        "question": "Can you apply a good smelling deodorant over this product if you wanted a good smell over this antiperspirant?",
        "answer": "Yes! I just want to make sure you do know that this deodorant is for night time use. Put it on at night, before you go to bed & preferably (not necessary) after you have showered or bathed at night time. That way, you are clean when you apply it. They do have a daytime version, but the daytime version is really just as a refresher & does not accomplish anything with regards to helping you to stop perspiring. If you apply this at night time, then you can apply whatever you want in the morning. I use my regular girly smelling deo in the morning. They work great together."
    },
    {
        "question": "I can use the next morning a normal deodorant?",

        "question": "I take showers in the morning, so would I apply this at night still? And its completely fine to scrub my armpits in the shower?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! I was worried about this too when I first started using this product. I shower in the morning as well and apply Certain Dri every other night before I go to bed. Essentially you want to give it the time to \"soak in\" so to speak and do its magic over night. Then by morning it won't matter if you wash your armpits in the shower. Hope this helps!"
    },
    {
        "question": "If i use it at night time do i need to shower or clean my underarms prior to using? (Coming from person who showers in morning)",
        "answer": "It seems to work best when you shower at night. If you shower in the morning it doesn't work quite as well. Either way this product is better than anything you will find at Walgreens, so if this is a problem for you buy it and try it both ways."

    },
    {
        "question": "Does it really work? does it help nails look better for real?",
        "answer": "Yes it does. You have to keep on it. My mum had a really bad nail and once she started this, it started to get better from the skin/root. She keep using it until her new nail is grown out. So it would take time but it worth it. Now, you can't tell she had a bad nail and she don't have to use this anymore. So give it a try."

    {
        "question": "I am baffled by the small print on the label that says, \"This product is not effective on the scalp or nails.\" Huh?????",
        "answer": "It's true: it's NOT effective on nails. I bought this in Sept. 2013. It stated on the packaging that is was not effective for nails, and references treatment for athlete's foot and ringworm. The package picture is misleading. I gave it a try by first filing down my nail and exposing as much of the underlying tissue as possible. This product had no effect on the fungus in my nail bed. I stopped using the Fungi Nail solution in July 2013. For the last year, I have been using only a solution of original flavor Listerine, distilled white vinegar directly after showering and letting it dry on the nail and surrounding tissue. I stuck to this regiment religiously for a full year. I removed and filed down the damaged nail regularly. Additionally, I stopped wearing toenail polish and wore open-toed shoes whenever possible. My nail is now almost fully healed and grown back in normally. Only a very small edge of damaged nail needs to finish growing out."

        "answer": "Match the color of your mustache and beard. My beard is brown and my stache is light so I use brown to match the rest of my beard. Don't worry about your skin tone. If you have black hair, use black. Hope that helps."

        "question": "'Does it contain safflower oil?",
        "answer": "Hmmmm... good question. It is not on the list of ingredients but in the description it says, \"CLA (conjugated linoleic acid) is derived from safflower oil.\" So since it is titled \"Tonalin CLA,\" I guess that it is made from safflower oil, but safflower oil, itself, is not \"listed\" as one of the ingredients."

        "question": "What sticks do you buy with this? I see \"fertility monitor sticks\" here on Amazon, but it has only 7 reviews? That can't be right? What are they call?",
        "answer": "They are called fertility monitor test sticks. There's 30 in a box. They have a photo that includes a purple capped end. Another good way to kinda know is if you scroll down and it shows suggested items or items that others also purchased while purchasing the monitor. That is also a food indication you got the right ones"

        "question": "Are they individually wrapped? If I use one, will the others dry out? I would like to use them after a light workout.",
        "answer": "These are wrapped eight to a resealable package. Unless you are a very petite person you would need to use more than one after a workout (unless you only wipe pits and groin). I have had them stay fresh for two weeks, but I do not think I would push the freshness factor any longer. The main purpose of these wipes are to give sponge baths to those that cannot take a regular shower/bath. The package shows the recommended use pattern. I am very happy with this product and use them on a regular basis as I am not able to take a regular shower/bath, but these still give me the dignity of providing my personal hygiene."

        "question": "Does it work for your hair as well?",
        "answer": "I did not use it on my hair. However, there is a product on Amazon called \"No Rinse Shampoo\" which is a liquid but requires NO rinsing. You can even apply to the hair of a bedridden patient. The hair does become wet and you then dry with a regular hair dryer. Smells great. Definitely recommend!"

The name is listed on the product on where is it distributed to Amazon. A good start: http://www.carex.com/wps/portal/c/products?clear=true if that does not work than your best bet is eBay which has everything under the sun for hard to get items."

        "answer": "I have both, actually all 5 of Clubman's after shave products, on my bathroom vanity. There is no doubt there is a difference in the 2 in question. In reality, all 5 have their own distinct aroma. I can't decide which is my favorite so I alternate all of them throughout the week. There is something similar with all, that unique Clubman recipe, but each have their own unique experience. If you like the original, I can't imagine you would be disappointed."

        "question": "You all say it smells good, but how does it actually condition the skin?",

        "answer": "It depends on what lancing device you use. My last One Touch meter came without a lancing device. In general, lancets are pretty generic. I personally like the one-touch branded lancets (LifeScan) because the needle protector is like a cup or cap that fits right over the lancing needle, instead of a disk like some of the lancets. (If you order test strips some sellers will give you lancing needles, but they always seem to be the ones with the disks on the needle.) I remove the old lancet and put the new lancet in the device and remove the cap and put it on the old lancet and dispose of it in my sharps container. (I only change twice a week or if I let someone else use my lancing device.) I don't cap the lancet while it's in the device. I don't feel changing it every poke is worth the time and only a couple of times a year does my finger hurt and it's more likely where on the finger I poke it or if I didn't clean my finger enough first, rather than infections on the needle (except if I poke a not-well-cleaned finger and the next one transmits from the dirty finger to an otherwise clean finger and infects it."

You might have to play with the weight adjustments, as the higher the weight, the higher it pushes you up..Its not comfortable to sit on every day, but works well when you go out...The one I use is 5 years old, and the more you use it setting it up and closing it, the easier it is to bend and open up."

I had given up on electrics a few years back. They seemed to cheapen many of them up (those at reasonable price points), and I got electric razor burn, big time...where people even commented! So, I went to shaving with razor blades, disposables, many different types on market, had my share of facial cuts, etc. Wanted to try something. This thing had some decent reviews on Amazon. I took a chance....it seems to be working. Dunno how it would handle others, or how it would be for various groups, but hey...for less than 50 bucks from Amazon, it might be worth a chance. Look at it this way maybe....it's about the cost of perhaps a week of lunches at a fast food place and some coffee breaks. Yeah, it's a gamble...but you may win.

However, prior to getting this bed, we did have it set up on an existing full size regular bed and the arm was not sturdy enough. When my mom would pull up on the bar it would not remain stationary."

It is small, lightweight and has a long cord."

Because soft contact lenses are so fragile the inserter remover might damage them. The short time I used soft contacts I simply used my fingers to remove them. You can try it because the cost is relatively low, but remember that the soft contacts are fragile and can easily be damaged. I hope this answer helps."

        "answer": "First thing in the morning, on an empty stomach and (if possible) at least 30 minutes before eating a meal. I would take it on an empty stomach when you wake up in the morning or before bed. When you first get up, take the probiotic, then get ready for the day preferably waiting at least 30 minutes before you eat breakfast. You can also take the probiotic with food and still get pretty good absorption.. The reason this may decrease some absorption of a supplement probiotic is that the probiotic ends up spending more time in the stomach. Also, another reason to take them on an empty stomach is because before the journey to the intestines, the bacteria will have more difficulty surviving the harsh stomach acid during digestion, affecting their potency. But, don't take them after a meal! Probiotics that are taken after a meal have even more difficulty surviving stomach acid levels as this is when your stomach acid is at it's highest. A study from last year found that when a probiotic supplement was taken after a meal, extremely low levels of bacteria survived. A recent study in the Journal of Beneficial Microbes showed that probiotics are optimally absorbed when taken prior to a meal and were absorbed almost as well when taken with a meal containing fats."

        "question": "Can you mix this into food such as ground beef?",
        "answer": "I never tried this mixture and you can only experiment to find out what you prefer. However, the powder mix is already a SuperFood which compensates for the nutrients you are losing on a daily basis. For example, the food pyramid tells us to eat certain amounts of fruits, vegetables, grains , etc thru-out the day, but with Greens Plus it gives you that well balance in just one glass! You mix it with water. You can be creative and add a banana or another of your favorite fruit. For myself, I choose not to add SuperFood, something that is already potent with nutrional value, to a cooked food which will take away that value. Ask yourself, what is it that I want to accomplish? If you decide to use the Super Food - Greens Plus you will begin to see how great you feel, aches & pains begin to diminish (a little). Cooked food takes away ALL NUTRIENTS which the body needs. Read up on the ingredients and decide. Hope this was helpful and let me know how it works out for you. Oh by the way, I am not a doctor nor am I a nutrionist. Just one who have been using the product for some time and it made me a believer. Watch the documentary video \"Fat Sick & Nearly Dead\" this is where I first learned of Greens Plus."

I will be on the lookout NOT to purchase anything more from Vitamin Discount Center, as I had a heck of a time trying to return the product.

Just pull hard enough at that point and the battery compartment will pull out.

        "question": "which is better...cod liver oil or fish oil? I noticed that the DHA is higher in Cod Liver Oil...is this better or is the ratio the factor?",
        "answer": "When using the word \"better\" you need to define paramaters. A naturally harvested cod liver oil, Carlson for example, is tested for mercury content and many other very dangerous chemicals that have found their way into most fish. Cod liver oil is higher in vitamin D content, the lack of which has recently been associated with MS, and several other very bad afflictions. On the less severe list of afflictions is joint pain, a feeling of just feeling crappy, arthritis-like pains in the back, and so forth. One of the better medical websites maintained by an MD who has been associated with vitamins and minerals recommends 2000 IU's of vitamin D per day but unfortunately, all this vitamin crap you find on the big chain store shelves is synthetic - which means you system AT BEST is only absorbing ten percent of what you take of the synthetic crapola. The Carlson cod liver oil is produced in Norway and even though a teaspoon only contains 400 IUs of D, it is very pure so your system absorbs it all. Unfortunately, to preserve the cod liver oil's freshness, vitamin A is added, which means that every teaspoonful of codliver oil also has about twice as many IUs of vitamin A. Excess amount of vitamin A can be hazardous to your liver. So, we can say that the naturally harvested cod liver oil is \"better\" because it has no contaminants and is far more easily absorbed by your system, but the higher content of vitamin A it contains to preserve freshness is not so good, which makes it less better? I am afraid of fish oil because most contain a lot of mercury, and purity has always been in question."
    },
    {
        "question": "How many mg. of EPA and DHA is in each teaspoon (which is the recommended dose)?",
        "answer": "Carlson's Norwegian Cod Liver Oil contains 1,100 mg Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Of this, 500 mg. is DHA and 400 mg. is EPA. Many sources recommend 1 gram (1,000 mg) of EPA/DHA for maintenance, and this comes very close to what is contained in the 1 tsp. recommended dose. The air inside the bottle is replaced with nitrogen to keep it from becoming rancid before opening. They also add \"a natural source\" of Vitamin E to retard spoilage. Even though directions say to refrigerate after opening, I personally refrigerate it at all times. If you have a specific condition for which you want to take more than one gram of EPA/DHA, this this brand of Cod Liver Oil (which has 850 IU of Vitamin A) will not cause you to get too much Vitamin A. It contains 17% of the daily requirement in 1 tsp. I believe this is true of their fish oil as well. It is regularly tested for purity and freedom from detrimental levels of mercury, cadmium, lead, PCB's and 28 other contaminants by an independent FDA registered laboratory."

Although they carry several products none of them were listed as organic, so I am still searching. I think having the name have organic in it almost makes it a false advertisement. Frustrating. Now I see conflicting information. One label says organic alfalfa, but then says it also contains parabens (Methylparaben, Propylparaben). Do we want to eat those? Could it be that their labels could maybe be different on different batches?"

Nevertheless, the product is very effective for repairing the brain. It might be something you can take in the form of a therapeutic trial and see if you have any ill effects.

        "question": "Previous info on this product said IT WAS WATERED WITH SEA WATER FROM THE PACIFIC off the coast of Hawaii. { downstream from Fukushima}",
        "answer": "Found this: &lt;&lt; FUKUSHIMA RADIOACTIVITY CONCERNS &gt;&gt; (Added 13/03/2012) Fukushima radioactivity impact report: Nutrex/Cyanotech assure me (and the public) they have not experienced any fallout or related effects from the Fukushima nuclear power plant incident in Japan. They have made this public statement: &gt;&gt;\" Cyanotech implemented monitoring of our Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica and BioAstin Natural Astaxanthin products immediately after the disaster in Japan through independent third party laboratory analysis. The analyses found no detectable radiation (less than 1.0 Bq/kg for iodine-131; less than 0.5 Bq/kg for cesium-134; and less than 0.6 Bq/kg for cesium-137), in products produced on 3/22/2011, which was the time in which it was theorized that the tail of the radiation plume from Japan could reach Hawaii. Cyanotech continues to test its products for radiation contamination through independent third party laboratory analysis to ensure that they are the highest quality, most healthful products available in the supplement industry. Recent radiation testing of Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica and BioAstin products find no detectable radiation.\" &lt;&lt; (End Quote) For those people concerned about radioactivity in general, please note that Spirulina has been proven to significantly reduce the ill effects of radiation exposure. If you want to maximise that effect look into using Astaxanthin, which is extracted from Spirulina. It is the primary antioxidant in Spirulina, and is considered to be the most potent anti-oxidant we know of. There are many options for this on Amazon so I recommend doing a search to see them all. &lt;&lt; MY CONCLUSIONS &gt;&gt; Nutrex Hawaiian Spirulina is a great product and I am sure you'll be as or more happy with it that the other spirulina options. Ideally go for the powder, but if you can't stomach it, switch to tablets. If you want certified organic you'll have to go with a potentially fowl tasting variety from India. If you simply want US made, use either Hawaiian (Nutrex or one of the other brands I listed) or Earthrise (from CA).

        "question": "The description states \"375% more protein than tofu\", but I bought this product and it says 1 serving has 3g of protein, which is correct?",
        "answer": "Algae products can vary hugely between crops and between manufacturer in protein/carb/fat content. If that's what you want, get a protein powder. Spirulina is used for other things. Although the fat content, and B12 are important for vegans, and they should be more specific about those. But don't rely on spirulina for protein. Rely on it to detoxify, give energy, and in some cases, reduce the symptoms of modern diseases like diabetes and bad cholesterol. It's more of an antioxidant and a body rejuvenator, not a protein drink."

Step 2) Take hold of a blade by the sides (longwise) and pull directly out. They're held on to their posts mostly by tension, so no tools are required. Repeat for the other blade. Step 3) Clean the shaver off so the posts are devoid of all your residual shavings and general buildup. This will ensure the new blades will sit well. Step 4) Put on new blades on their respective posts. Press down to ensure they are seated correctly, but not too hard as (A) they are razor blades, and (B) the retentive posts are made from plastic. Step 5) Snap the guard/head back on and resume your carefree life or convenient shaving. ~M~"

        "question": "What does CoQ10 specifically do to support ones health?",
        "answer": "So there are three main functions to support cardiovascular health. The first is that CoQ10 is a naturally occurring oil based vitamin like substance that participates in the ATP formation in the mitochondria (fancy way of saying it helps with cellular energy). The second action links the first and third action in that coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) also acts like an antioxidant in helping eliminate free radicals. The third action is the most profound for cardiovascular health. CoQ10 'prevents oxidation of LDL' which means it helps cut down on the formation of LDL. LDL stands for low density lipoprotein and since it acts as a transport molecule for fat stores to the arterial wall it can lead to atherosclerosis and hypertension. In a 362 pt meta analysis CoQ10 was found to lower systolic BP by 17 pts and Diastolic BP by 10 pts. Whenever you look at vitamins or medications you have to look at the cost/benefit. Obviously there is the cost of the medication, but more importantly CoQ10 has not been shown to have detrimental health effects, and the benefit is possibly astronomical. Hope this helps."

I carry mine in the net pouch of my carry on bag and have gone days without having to soak again and insulin stayed cool. I haven't tried it but think that if you put it inside an airtight container, it would not be able to stay cool due to lack of evaporation."

        "answer": "I'm sorry, but dietary cholesterol has virtually no affect on the bodies cholesterol levels, and modern science supports this. Like most (mis)information, this \"dietary cholesterol bad\" myth was probably instituted by a study sponsored by the cereal/grain companies or something back in the 70's or 80's. Just like the whole \"fat is bad\" fad that took off during the 80's when low/no-fat everything came out. What happened next? Add in the processed fructose (corn syrup). Why corn syrup? Because corn is/was subsidized the US Govt (our tax dollars) and they put a tariff on imported sugar cane, making corn syrup the de'facto sweetener in American processed food. And why did that \"fat is bad\" thing take off? Because companies used the absolute cheapest forms of fat (hydrogenated vegetable oils). And what's cheaper than hydrogenated fats and that can be flown into foods under the radar? Processed fructose."

Spirulina is used for other things. Although the fat content, and B12 are important for vegans, and they should be more specific about those. But don't rely on spirulina for protein. Rely on it to detoxify, give energy, and in some cases, reduce the symptoms of modern diseases like diabetes and bad cholesterol. It's more of an antioxidant and a body rejuvenator, not a protein drink."

None are in the United States, where GMO corn is all too common. All are from Europe and the Far East, situated in countries that (to date) have restrictions that do not allow GMO food corn to be grown there. Our producers have given us statements to confirm that their corn sources are non-GMO, but the documentation doesn't extend back to the farm level. Testing for GMOs has not found that any is detectable in vitamin C. We have done all that is currently possible to assure that our vitamin C is non-GMO, and continue to monitor the situation to ensure this is maintained in the future.\" Hope that helps :-)"

        "answer": "Most vitamin c is synthesized from corn. I try to always take vitamin c complex, that is with bioflavonoids and rutin and hesperidin (also flavonoids.) This makes it closer to the way vitamin c would occur in nature. Also, buffered c may help the absorption and utilization. If you want natural vitamin c, you have to get a supplement that has it extracted from foods, like amla, camu camu, peppers, and such. You'll pay considerably more for those and the potencies will be lower, but the natural vitamin c doesn't require as large a dose as synthetic."

        "answer": "I dont think this a protein but i guess the collagen powder does , all I can say that this collagen really works for me . My hair, nails are much stronger and my skin complexion looks smoother and feels tight then ever . but here its some reviews about this amazing product I hope this can help u a little better.Collagen Type 1&3 Bene&#64257;ts:* Provides speci&#64257;c amino acids necessary to replenishing the body's collagen supply helps minimize &#64257;ne lines & wrinkles, and improves elasticity in the skin builds and supports bone matrix, corrects weak, broken, split and damaged nail beds thickens &#64257;ne hair, adds body and slows down hair loss repairs connective tissues for improved elasticity; improves circulation; promotes wound healing glycine builds lean muscle to help burn fat while you sleep. Collagen: The Body's Anti-Aging Protein Collagen supplementation is one of the most fundamental things a person can do to prevent premature aging and promote youthful vitality. Understanding collagen begins with knowing that it is truly the glue that holds the body together; it is the building block for all our body's major systems. Although abundant in our youth, the body's natural collagen production typically slows at a rate of 1.5% per year after the age of 25. As this collagen production slows, the collagen &#64257;bers in the body become brittle and begin to break down resulting in many of the tell-tale signs of aging, such as loose, &#64258;accid skin, wrinkles, ligament and tendon injuries and osteoarthritis. Super Collagen+C utilizes Collagen Types 1&3, which is 90% of the body's total collagen supply and the main collagen constituents in the skin, hair, nails, ligaments, tendons, bones and muscles.* The Science of Collagen Super Collagen 1&3 is composed of nineteen amino acids and is a rich source of glycine, proline, alanine and hydroxyproline. Once taken orally, it can produce peptides that stimulate &#64257;broblast cells to produce and reorganize new collagen &#64257;bers which, upon bundling, can build the mechanical strength of the connective tissues and strengthen the extracellular matrix.* Super Collagen's Advanced Bioavailability Super Collagen+C uses an advanced enzymatic hydrolyzation process to break the large collagen molecules into low molecular-weight peptides that are both bioavailable and bioactive in the body. Super Collagen+C contains hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine, two amino acids speci&#64257;c to Collagen. These are not regularly found in amino acid supplements and are especially important to collagen production. Collagen+C genetically parallels the amino acid structure of the body's collagen and it's been shown that persons taking hydrolyzed Collagen Type 1&3 will experience 90% absorption into the blood stream where cellular changes occur. * Available in 3 different, bioavailable delivery systems: powder, tablets and liquid. Super Collagen+C tablets and Super Collagen+C Pomegranate Liquid are formulated with Vitamin C, which is absolutely essential to collagen formation. Super Collagen powder is water-soluble, neutral tasting, and mixes easily with water or juice containing Vitamin C, or other Vitamin C supplements are highly recommended. The Diference Between Collagen Type 1&3 and Collagen Type 2: Scienti&#64257;c studies show that more than 90% of the collagen found in the body is Collagen Type 1&3. The protein composition consists of nineteen amino acids responsible for the growth and maintenance of the body with unusually high percentages of glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline, which are all found in the skin and muscle. Collagen Type 2 protein consists of eighteen amino acids, which amino acid pro&#64257;les parallel the pro&#64257;le of the joint cartilage. Collagen Type 1&3 and Collagen Type 2 should not be combined due the types having different amino acid pro&#64257;les. If taken together, the two proteins will bind and form a complete protein and the body will not recognize it as collagen. It is recommended that if you want to take both sources of collagen protein, it should be done at least an hour apart.* *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

        "question": "Is there MSG in the product? The description mentions MSG but does not state if this product has it.",
        "answer": "MSG was first crystallized using this exact species of seaweed in 1908. Glutamic acid is a naturally occurring amino acid in many foods. When this seaweed is boiled and reduced the glutamic acid and the naturally present salts form MSG. So while this product may not list MSG as an additive you are putting the same chemicals in your body. Learn a little about the foods you eat before jumping on a useless hate bandwagon."

        "question": "Should you shave armpits before using this?",
        "answer": "No, I would say. The crystal is a salt, so if you shave first it would probably sting a bit when used. I am a male, so don't have the dilemma. Just to make sure I tried it on a small cut on my finger and it stings. It is a natural salt, ammonium alum, which back in the day men used to stop the little spots bleeding after shaving with a single straight edge razor. It won't hurt you in the long run, but would sting if there is any little cuts or nicks from shaving your armpits. Also depends if you use an electric shaver or a blade type. The trick is to either keep you underarms a little wet, or wet the deodorant stick, then go round and round or up and down in the armpit making sure it gets on everything under your arm - hair and skin- and then I blow dry my armpits. And for me, it keeps any odor away all day! LOL"
    },
    {
        "question": "does this contain aluminum?",
        "answer": "Yes - it contains ammonium alum, a.k.a. ammonium aluminum sulfate, a double sulfate salt. This, or potassium aluminum sulfate, is the primary ingredient in every \"mineral salt\" or \"crystal\" deodorant. This molecule does not form a gel plug in your sweat pores the same way aluminum-containing antiperspirants do. It is somewhat acidic in solution, which could potentially cause skin irritation. The EWG gives it a \"low hazard\" rating, and it's designated as a safe food additive by the FDA. Various sources claim that aluminum in this form can or cannot be absorbed through the skin, but with no reliable citations that I've found. Personally, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Longitudinal studies of aluminum exposure haven't revealed any significant health concerns. If you absolutely insist on avoiding all forms of aluminum in your deodorant, whip up a solution of baking soda and water."

From personal experience, it is very strong stuff. I've used it for burns many times since discovering it and it works GREAT!!! I've used it for a sore throat, too. I highly recommend Oreganol drops and soft gels and Oregamax!!!"

I've used it several times where I knew I would be walking quite a bit with no place to sit down. It of course can double as a walking cane which is neat. I thought it well worth the price."

I've bee sleeping on my pillow for a few weeks now, and still like it, my only complaint if I need to have one is my whole body is a little lower in the bed, so my feet are at the very bottom of the bed.

        "answer": "There are two things you can do: first, you do not have to be all the way at the top for the wedge to work; just make sure the bottom comes at least to your waist so you don't bend or fold in the middle and put extra pressure on your stomach. Second, if you are a back sleeper, place a pillow beneath your knees; if you are a side sleeper, place a pillow between your knees. This should prevent sliding."

I has to be safe 24/7 and the feeding tube has already fallen out and had to be surgically replaced. I used the extra thin DupDerm to hold the dressing on the skin under the stoma and also to help anchor the heavy tube. It doesn't irritate my akin like all other tape and such. They also have thick DuoDerm to try. I cut it down to whatever I need and for each use which makes it last longer. Great product and awesome way to apply dressings etc and not irritate the skin."

        "question": "To remove, I was told that once edges are pulled up, removing it in the shower and letting water get in there can help with removing rest of patch?",
        "answer": "My experience has been that the patch begins to fall off after 5-6 days (maximum recommended time to have on is 7 days). I wash the patch area like any other, and perhaps this is a factor. Occasionally it has sort of crumpled up and fallen off in the shower - careful, what a horrorshow if it went down the drain and provided some nice and unusual work for a plumber, but then again it crumples to a not too large, not too sticky piece. I have not specifically tried the method you suggest since I feel that I should leave it on for the 7 days, assuming one of the above doesn't occur, but I'd guess that like most other rubbery cements that heat makes it somewhat less effective, so I'd think your method has some chance of success. Assuming it stays on for 7 days I just lift up a corner and begin to peel off, moving the fingers continually inward into the patch to lift it up - I find it less comfortable if one lifts the corner and then continues to pull from the corner. Of course all the above advice is given without knowing details of your disease or skin condition so can be nothing but a general comment about what works for me. My situation was relatively minor but still a terrific product which cured my condition for $3.75 (3 pads) vs. hundreds for the dermatologist had I not been insured."

I use my bed pad for my baby and he probably doesn't even release 800 cc's at a time anyway - but looking at the bed pad 1800 would probably be the ABSOLUTE max it could absorb.

I don't see any warnings about plastic or acrylic. The primary ingredients are Xylene, Ethylbenzene and Toluene and Benzene. I suspect you won't want it to sit on plastics and acrylics for a prolonged period of time. All the ingredients are pretty nasty stuff so wear gloves and protect your eyes from spray-back and use it in a very well ventilated space.

It has two ratings right now. One is good and one isn't. However, we have this and it is a bit slippery and may be the help you need to slide yourself across the Roho. It can slide over the roho (like a pillow case) yet it's open on both ends. If you want more details on this, you can also find it at usmedicalstore.com. If you're going to ride with this cover on while you're riding in the car, you may want to put something underneath it to keep the \"bottom\" of the cushion from sliding out from under you. My father's doctor recommended that we \"don't\" use the cushion cover that came with the Roho as it is too thick and can cause pressure sores because of the stiffness and thickness of the Roho cover that comes with the Roho. Do you have anyone who can help you slide onto your cushion? I know these are a bit hard to slide on because of the depth of the cushion."

        "answer": "I wish I could help you. Wind Song \"was\" one of my favorites. I had a cardboard tube of Wind Song body powder and I absolutely loved it. It had the loveliest smell. I could use it like cologne. I liked to put it on my arms and chest at night and it smelled good all night and the next morning. I understood from the sales clerks they didn't make it any more. So I ordered the body powder--2 times--the first one didn't smell nearly good as what I had before, and the second one I have now I just don't like at all. The odor is actually a little offensive to me. I thought maybe I had changed somehow. I have used the cologne and also think there is a change in the scent and the time it lasts on me. So I have been disappointed, too. I didn't get in touch with the company but that may the only way to find out what it going on. I think we could Google it. But you are right, there has been changes in their Wind Song products. Sadly. Mary Ann Froelich"

I can get by with having some soy as I don't ingest huge amounts of it so for me I weigh the pros and cons. I don't personally have a bad reaction to soy if it is small amounts. I hope this helps, as I do understand the healthcare journey and that being pro-active is a huge undertaking and can be frustrating. I wish you well and good luck on your journey. Sincerely iamxoxo"

In the FAQ they admit there is a small amount of gluten in Greens First. The \"law\" says if your product has less than 20 ppm gluten you may label it \"gluten free.\" This is great for the companies cashing in on the gluten free food fad, but not for people with celiac disease. Now we have to do even MORE homework before we can eat. If you have celiac disease, and you really want to try this, use a small amount first. I did, and all the celiac symptoms and complications kicked in. Be smarter than I, and do some extra homework first!"

        "answer": "Even though the directions for the alarm tell you to only use underwear, we used pull-ups for the first week to minimize the clean ups. My son wore briefs with the alarm on the underwear and then wore a pull-up over it. The alarm still worked without a problem, however the idea is train your child's brain to link together a full bladder and feeling wet so the bed wetting will stop ( and it will!) after we got used to the alarm and routine we eliminated the pull-ups, and yes there may be 1 or 2 messes a night to clean until the training starts to work. We used disposable bed mats to help minimize the wet bed messes at night. But trust me, I was the biggest skeptic of this alarm and all the late nights it would cause. I had an eight year old who never had a dry night in his entire life, after 8 weeks, he was fully trained and to date has only had one accident in 3 months.... No more pull-ups an he gained a huge boost in self confidence!"

Unclipping the red part just involves lifting a small lever and pulling the clip off. To get it back on is a little harder, because the child has to get the material from the underpants inside the red clip, but my 7.5 y.o. son was able to do it with no trouble. Surprisingly, though, within a short time my son didn't even need to get up overnight to use the toilet because he was making it all night while holding it."

The four legs under the seat go in the tub, and the little side bench fits over the tub side, with the other two legs on the outside of the tub. (You can put the bench on either side of the seat.) The legs are adjustable, so you can make sure all six feet are sitting securely on the floor and the bottom of the tub. To get in the tub/shower, you can sit on the bench part and then slide over onto the seat. My wife used this after she had foot surgery and couldn't get her foot wet; we put a folding chair outside the tub for her to prop her leg on while she took a shower. Hope this helps.

        "answer": "The only difference I can tell is the color. Looking at both on Amazon, they have 1 year warranties, air bladders, and straps to hold them in place. I have the corflex blue and it is great! My mother-in-law had originally bought several of these pillows from her PT and I liked them so much that when mine died, I bought some more on Amazon."

        "answer": "If you mean you will be sitting on the floor and you stick this between you and the wall, it would stay in place until you moved, but you can't attach it to the wall in any way. It would just fall over. Not sure I know what you mean."

        "question": "I like this pillow, but it constantly loses air. I have to reinflate it about every 5th time is use it. Doesn't it have a lifetime guarantee?",
        "answer": "Air always escapes through the walls of anything plastic -- like balloons, for example. That's science. Auto tires, too, which is why you have to add air periodically, and tires are a lot thicker than the walls of this pillow. So if you get four uses out of it before adding air, I'd say that's pretty good. If it doesn't hold air for one use, then you'd have an issue to complain about."

Do not use polish on brushed stainless steel appliances. MAAS Stainless Steel & Chrome Spray Cleaner is recommended to clean, polish and protect brushed factory finishes.\" So I would say that MAAS International Metal Polish would not be the appropriate metal polish for dishwashers or refrigerators as they have brushed finishes.

        "answer": "If you have many silver pieces I used a silver dip solvent that Amazon has also, after washing and drying the pieces, I use the Maas following the directions. The difference is amazing, even on silverware. The shine is a beautiful silver; but the best part is the protection that it gives you. You do not have to use a plastic bag to protect the shine, it will stay on its own. I also use this on my Vanity Car, baby blue T-Bird on all of its chrome inside and out. It lasts in that environment for about 4 months. I do it again and even in the elements, it is amazing. I actually started using for all of my metal cleaning after talking with a friend who shows antique cars. It is all that many competitors use in that arena. You will not be disappointed. If Maas cannot get the tarnish off - your pieces will need to be replated."

What the Maas doesn't remove use bar keepers friend, actually you can just use the bar keeper friend but it won't polish it up as nicely as Maas or keep it from tarnishing as quickly. Use the bar keeper with a sponge or soft cloth and don't rub it with a lot of force. I have used it on my Paul Revere cookware for a long time with no damage."

        "answer": "Between meals and before bed, when nutritional support won't be available for a while, casein protein can help provide longer lasting amino acid support. Casein proteins are pH sensitive and gel in the acidic environment of the stomach. As a result, it can take longer for caseins to be broken-down into their amino acid subcomponents than whey and other proteins. Because of their unique slow-digesting qualities, caseins are described as anti-catabolic or muscle-protecting proteins."

Is there a risk of your seaweed and algae products being contaminated by radiation from Japan or being irradiated as a sterilization technique? A. No. These foods were sourced far from Fukushima and its prevailing ocean currents, and it is illegal to use irradiation as a food processing method to sterilize raw materials used in dietary supplements in the U.S. or Natural Health Products in Canada. To confirm the safety of our Organic Chlorella (Hainan Island in the South China Sea), Kelp powder (North Atlantic-Iceland), Organic Spirulina (India), and Carrageenan (Philippines) we tested each of them with our sophisticated PSL instrument, which can detect signatures of prior radiation exposures. The results were that these products did not test positive for irradiation."

        "question": "regrowth question: Could users of the Panasonic facial trimmer please comment on the hair regrowth after using this product for sometime?",
        "answer": "I used one of these (finishing touch lumina) a couple of days ago for the first time. My peach fuzz had to go...now. I am also blonde fair skinned and of a certain age. :-) I did not press it against my skin while using. I just floated it over my skin as lightly as possible. Afterward you do notice a difference in how the hair feels - it has just been blunt cut, so it has a slightly less smooth feeling. I was completely shocked by how much fuzz came off. I'll take a teeny difference in the way that hairs feels versus a big difference in being able to see it. I read an article from American Family Physicians website ( http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/1115/p1907.html ) that says \"Shaving does not change the thickness or growth rate of human hair. Rather, the rough-textured, beveled edge that shaving produces (compared with the softer, tapered tip of uncut hair) may give the appearance of thickening. Although shaving is a useful and safe method of facial hair removal (and the chief method chosen by men), it is not popular among women. Side effects of shaving are generally minimal. Irritation, often caused by components of the shaving lubricant, and minor cuts can occur. Pseudofolliculitis barbae, caused by the ingrowth of curly hair, is also a fairly common side effect in some ethnic groups.\" Since I am not \"clean shaving\" by trying to remove the hair at or below the surface, my facial hair is not curly, nor am I using any shaving product, I don't expect to experience ingrown hairs. So far, I'm completely happy about my choice to \"just do it\". Best of luck!"

Fish oils, on the other hand, are \"good to go\" with no conversion necessary. I love flax for its moisturizing abilities, but also take fish oil as my real omega-3 source. As for flax being somehow cleaner because this one is organic, look for a molecularly distilled, domestic (Alaskan) type of fish oil (or just pure wild salmon oil) and you will be fine.

        "question": "Does the elevating legrest refer to the padding for the calf? It was not pictured here.",
        "answer": "Hi. We wondered about this too but ordered anyway. The \"elevating legrest\" means that those feet supports actually raise up to just about parallel to the wheelchair seat. They do also have calf supports built in, but ours at least were not padded--they are more of a hard plastic. The elevating feature is really helpful for my wife when she needs to rest her legs. In order for the elevated feature to work, we fold the bottom footrest portion out of the way then elevate the leg rests and her legs rest on the calf supports. If we don't fold the foot part out of the way it's too cramped, and she's not a large lady by any means (about 5'4\"). These elevating footrests are still removable from the chair too when you need to load it in a car, etc. It has worked out great for us. Hope that info helps. Any specific questions let me knwo and I'll try to answer."

        "answer": "If you have ever been to a VA hospital and see all the huge men & women using Invacare wheelchairs, you will understand why they only buy Invacare units as they will hold up. My husband was in his for 7 years until he was granted 2 hip replacements. Now it is being used by his overweight mother in a nursing home and it gets a lot of abuse there from dementia banging into walls etc, yet it has held up fine. We got this new one to replace the old one that mom in law is in now, in case my husband needs it for the future as his hip replacements are wearing down some. Trust the fact that if the VA only buys Invacare wheelchairs then it will hold up for you!"

        "question": "How close and for how long each day do you have to sit? How often do the bulbs need replacing?",
        "answer": "12\" is the distance to get the 10,000 LUX light level and you can increase the distance, but you would need to also increase the time of exposure. The drop off in intensity at 24\" would be to about 2,500 LUX. This is the lowest level clinically tested and for comparable response most would need two hours of exposure at this level. However, keep in mind that your individual response may be different and you may need more of less time. It may take a few days to 2 weeks to find the right balance of time and distance to gain the benefits. CET.org is a great resource for information and they have free self-assessment tools to determine the best time in the day to use the lamp based on your own schedule. CFL bulbs lose intensity as they age, so the LUX level will diminish as the lamp is used and therefore you may not be getting the expected LUX level. Two years for replacement of the bulbs is a general rule, but will vary based on usage. If in two years, the lamp is still providing the same benefit in the same time, then there would be no need to replace the bulbs."

But it won't charge as you use it; only when the shaver is off. You could probably run the jet clean with water, but it's not recommended in the booklet (and may void your warranty). It's probably enough just to clean the blades after use with water by popping the top."

I take it with me to doctor's office, church pews, - just get a good chair with arms to sit in and set it at the appropriate weight. You might have to play with the weight adjustments, as the higher the weight, the higher it pushes you up..Its not comfortable to sit on every day, but works well when you go out...The one I use is 5 years old, and the more you use it setting it up and closing it, the easier it is to bend and open up."
